## Demo content folder structure

The repository folder structure is as follows.

```bash
.
└── playbooks/
    └── <domain>/
        └── <demo_name>/
            ├── demo_<playbook_name>.yml <-- Initial Ansible content for demo.
            ├── solution_<playbook_name>.yml <-- Tested Ansible content for comparison.
            └── prepare_<playbook_name>.yml <-- Initial Playbook to configure the demo environment.
```

* `<domain>` - Ansible examples are sorted by domain. For example, the _cloud_ folder contains AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud content.
* `demo_<playbook_name>.yml` - Playbooks that start with `demo_*` are the initial Ansible example to use in the demo. For example, _demo_provision_ec2_instance.yml_ located in the _cloud/aws_ folder.
* `prepare_<playbook_name>.yml` - Playbooks that start with `prepare_*` prepares the environment for the demo.
* `README.md` - Contains a video and step-by-step instructions to prepare and perform the demo.
* `solution_<playbook_name>.yml` - Playbooks that start with `solution_*` have been tested with the latest version of the Ansible Lightspeed model. Use the tested Ansible content to compare your Ansible Lightspeed-generated outputs before the demo.
